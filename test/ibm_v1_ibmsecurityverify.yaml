# This YAML contains a sample custom resource definition for the IBM Security
# Verify operator.  The main thing which needs to be customised in this
# YAML file is the clientSecret field, ensuring that this corresponds to
# the name of an actual secret which has been created and contains the IBM
# Security Verify credentials.

apiVersion: ibm.com/v1
kind: IBMSecurityVerify

metadata:
  name: ibmsecurityverify-sample

spec:
  # The name of the secret which contains the IBM Security Verify
  # client credentials.  If the secret is not in the same namespace as the
  # custom resource the secret name should be prefixed with the name of the
  # namespace in which the secret resides, for example:
  #    default/ibm-security-verify-client-1cbfe647-9e5f-4d99-8e05-8ec1c862eb47
  clientSecret: --secret--

  # The URL path, within the Ingress service, for the Verify SSO server.
  ssoPath: /verify-sso

  # The URL to which a client will be redirected upon logout.    If no
  # logout redirect URL is specified the server will not provide a mechanism
  # to logout the user.  The logout URI is constructed by appending the
  # '/logout' URL segment to the configured 'ssoPath'.
  logoutRedirectURL: https://www.ibm.com/au-en/products/verify-saas

  # The lifetime, in seconds, for an authenticated session. 
  sessionLifetime: 300
